# SIMPLE-CALCULATOR-using-C-
Develop a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.
Here is a simple C++ program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program allows the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.

How the Program Works
The program defines four functions to perform basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
The program defines a displayMenu function to display the calculator menu to the user.
The program uses a while loop to repeatedly display the menu and ask the user for their choice.
Based on the user's choice, the program asks for two numbers and performs the selected operation.
The program uses a try-catch block to handle any errors that may occur during the operation, such as division by zero.
